# ChessPersonality

## Introduction
The general idea of my project is to differentiate chess styles and personalities, as it might be useful to predict the outcomes of the games.<br>
Was this hipothesis true, the consequences could be immense. Previously coaches and players had not spent huge amount of time thinking this way, but these styles might turn out to be more important than we initially thought. <br>

Though we must mention, that the popular conception (just like what Rowson thought) is considered to imply that the importance of whether a move is "aggressive", "solid", "attacking, "defensive", "logical" or something else is little compared to whether a move is GOOD or not! Just liek the engines think nowadays, you either make good moves or not, the reasons for that hardly matters. <br>

However, we must realize that playing out different kinds of positions between the same players can impact the results more than we might have thought. This experiment of mine is aimed to clear the air in this regard. <br>

Lars Bo Hansen argues in his book, "*Foundations of Chess Strategy*" that nowadays people struggle to play all kinds of chess positions equally well, even though it was considered to be a neccessity in the past. <br>
He went on to categorize chess players into 4 different groups: 
  - [Activists](#activits)
  - [Reflectors](#reflectors)
  - Pragmatics
  - Theorists
  
I will move on to show what he thinks the recognizable traits of each category are. I will also add my ideas on what I think help us to classify a player into that group. 

### Activists
