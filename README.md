# ChessPersonality

## Introduction
The general idea of my project is to differentiate chess styles and personalities, as it might be useful to predict the outcomes of the games.<br>
Was this hipothesis true, the consequences could be immense. Previously coaches and players had not spent huge amount of time thinking this way, but these styles might turn out to be more important than we initially thought. <br>

Though we must mention, that the popular conception (just like what Rowson thought) is considered to imply that the importance of whether a move is "aggressive", "solid", "attacking, "defensive", "logical" or something else is little compared to whether a move is GOOD or not! Just liek the engines think nowadays, you either make good moves or not, the reasons for that hardly matters. <br>

However, we must realize that playing out different kinds of positions between the same players can impact the results more than we might have thought. This experiment of mine is aimed to clear the air in this regard. <br>

Lars Bo Hansen argues in his book, "*Foundations of Chess Strategy*" that nowadays people struggle to play all kinds of chess positions equally well, even though it was considered to be a neccessity in the past. <br>
He went on to categorize chess players into 4 different groups: 
  - [Activists](#activists)
  - [Reflectors](#reflectors)
  - Pragmatics
  - [Theorists](#theorists)

I will move on to show what he thinks the recognizable traits of each category are. I will also add my ideas on what I think help us to classify a player into that group. 

### Activists

### Reflectors

Traits:
  - very good at sensing and collecting small advantages
  - often very strong in endgames 
  - good at assessing the values of long term positional sacrifices 
  - calculate relatively few variations and make moves on general concepts, trying to utilize their undestranding
  - great feel for the pieces even in unknown positions
  
  - tendency for sloppy opening play or oversight (calculate relatively few variations)
  - might have troubles when playing forcing positions (or when detail-heavy positions arise)
  - opponents of reflectors might underestimate ideas
  
Players of this kind: Capablanca, Smyslov, Rubinstein, Petrosian, Karpov

### Theorists

Traits:
  - great understanding of pawn structures and how they affect the strategy
  - strong in closed and semi-closed positions (good manoeuvring)
  - often very strong utilizing the two-bishops
  - proceedings in the game are often logical and very systematic

Players of this kind:
